If you're unsure how to do this, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ Add data]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https://i.imgur.com/cIIWPUS.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Data** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nMYc1Nu.png\" width=30%><br/>\n</center>\n\nYou can click on the carat to the left of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.
